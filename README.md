# DistributedAmazonReviews

Goal - analyze book reviews to detect sarcasm.

This was done using Stanford's NLP library, using the sentiment analysis algorithm.

In order to maintain scalability, the system was deployed on to AWS, and implements microservices architecture.

This project was written as part of Ben-Gurion University's elective courses "Distributed Systems Programming".
